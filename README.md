# Maximizing Revenue for Taxi Cab Drivers through Payment Type Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores how different payment types (cash vs credit card) impact taxi fare revenue.  
Using **Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and Hypothesis Testing**, I tested whether payment method significantly affects fare amount.

## 🎯 Objective
- Investigate the relationship between fare amount and payment method.
- Perform hypothesis testing (t-test) to evaluate differences.
- Provide business recommendations to maximize driver revenue.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: NYC Yellow Taxi Data (January sample).
- Features: pickup/dropoff datetime, trip duration, fare amount, payment type, etc.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- SciPy, Statsmodels

## 🔎 Key Findings
- Credit card payments generally have higher average fares than cash.
- Hypothesis testing confirms a statistically significant difference.
- Business implication: **Encouraging credit card payments may increase driver earnings.**
